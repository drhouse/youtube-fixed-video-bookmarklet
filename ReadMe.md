How to use it
-------------
You can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3U9QQcLB9Q) if you don't understand bookmarklets. It will tell you exactly how to use this.

GitHub doesn't allow you to link to a JavaScript function, so here's the code for the link. Put that link somewhere, and then drag it to your bookmarks bar.
```html
<a class='bookmarklet' href="javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='//raw.github.com/tforbus/youtube-fixed-video-bookmarklet/master/script.js';})();">YouTube Fixed Video Bookmarklet</a>
```

If you don't want to do that, you can go to [this website](http://www.whattheforbus.com/youtube-bookmarklet) which already contains the link, so you just need to drag and drop.

Once that's in your bookmarks bar, just click it when you're on a YouTube video page, and the code is activated.
